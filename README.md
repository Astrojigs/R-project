# R-project
We can discuss our code and make changes here. I am currently uploading the cleaning part

**Note:** The Python code is just a rough work and consists of data cleaning part. **I'll convert the code in R in few days and upload it here**

# Update:
The cleaning part is almost complete, the only thing left to do now is, set up a linear model between the parameters which have null values and the correlation coeffienct is high.

We should be able to substitute null values with the predicted values.
